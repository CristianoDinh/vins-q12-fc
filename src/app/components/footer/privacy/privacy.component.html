        When we provide you with products or services we may collect and store any personal information that you provide to us. We may, for example, keep a secure record of your name, address, date of birth, delivery address, email address, telephone number and payment card details. We may also record details of any disability, health or dietary needs you may have at the time of booking an event or service which will take place at the stadium or any of our other premises to help to ensure your comfort and safety.
        <br><br>
        When you sign up with us for an online account, register to receive marketing communications from us (and/or our sponsors and partners), enter one of our competitions, fill in one of our forms (whether online or offline) or otherwise expressly provide us with your personal information,
        we will collect and securely store any personal information that you provide to us (which may include name, address, email address, date of birth and mobile telephone number) and may use it
        to personalise and improve your experience on our digital platforms, provide products and services you request from us (including personalisation of those products or services), and carry out profiling and market research.
        <br><br>
        When you interact with our website or other digital platforms, we may also automatically collect the following information about your visit. This information is processed on the basis of our legitimate interests to help us better understand how our supporters use our digital platforms to enable us create better content and more relevant communications:
        <br>
      </p>
      <br>

        If you apply for a job with us, we will use the personal information that you provide to process your application, to communicate with you regarding your application and to assess your suitability for the role.&nbsp; If you have any questions regarding the use, storage and retention of your personal information in relation to a job that you have applied for then, in addition to contacting the Data Protection Officer (details above), you can also contact People Services at

        We may also participate in ‘Audience’ services across all social media channels upon which Vins Q12 FC has a presence to display personalised advertisements when you visit these social media platforms.&nbsp; An example of these services is Facebook's ‘Custom Audience’ service. They work by converting your email address (or other personal data such as name, address, date of birth, mobile number and/or geographical location) to a unique number that the social media platform uses to match to unique numbers that the social media platform generates from email addresses of its users.&nbsp; Where we use such social media advertising services, we will only include you if you have consented to receive marketing from us.&nbsp; If you have given us your consent, you can change your mind at any time by sending an email to

        <strong>Cookies <br><br></strong>

        <strong>Security of information <br><br></strong>
        We take the security of your personal information extremely seriously. When you submit your credit card details to us, we use industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology to guard your information. In addition, we have robust security procedures in place to protect our paper based systems and computerised databases from loss and misuse, and only allow access to them when it is absolutely necessary to do so, and then under strict guidelines as to what use may be made of the personal information contained within them.

        Please note that for your safety and security, the safety and security of our staff and visitors,&nbsp;and for the prevention and detection of crime, CCTV is in operation in all of our premises which are open to the public.
        <br><br>
        There is signage in and around all sites which operate CCTV.
        <br><br>
        <strong>If you are under 16<br><br></strong>
        If you are under 16 and register for restricted areas of our digital platforms, we will collect your date of birth and retain that with your name and other details you may provide. This is so we can ensure we treat you in an age appropriate way in line with this policy.
        <br><br>
        For so long as you are under 16 we will not send you any marketing communications, allow you to access any of our digital platform message boards, or share your details with our Vins commercial partners.&nbsp; However, if you have signed up to receive a product or service we may contact you about this.
        <br><br>
        <em>Ages 13-15<br>
          <br>
        </em>
        If you are aged 13-15, you must first tell your parent or legal guardian that you wish to register on our digital platforms and get their consent. You must make sure that your parent or legal guardian knows and agrees each time before you:
        <br><br>

      <ul>
        <li>• email us, or ask us to email anything to you; </li>
        <li>• send any information to us; </li>
        <li>• enter any competition or game that requires information about you or offers a prize; </li>
        <li>• purchase an official membership; or </li>
        <li>• offer or agree to buy anything online. </li>
      </ul>
      <br><br><br>
      If you are the parent or legal guardian of a user of our digital platforms who is aged 13 to 15 we do not seek your direct consent to their registration, but we expect them to inform you and get your agreement in advance before they register and before each time they do any of the activities listed above.
      <br><br>
      <em>Aged under 13<br>
        <br>
      </em>
      If you are under 13, you may only use the restricted areas of our digital platforms if your parent or legal guardian has first told us that you are allowed to do so.
      <br><br>
      If you are under 13 and wish to register, you must truthfully tell us your name, email address, country and date of birth.&nbsp; Our system will then ask you for the name and email address of your parent or legal guardian. We will send them an email so they are aware of your request and will ask them for their consent and to confirm they have authority to give that consent. We need their consent or refusal within 7 days, or else we will assume consent is not granted. Their consent can be withdrawn at any stage.
      <br><br>
      Even if your parent or legal guardian gives their consent to your registration, if you are under 13 we still expect you to tell them and get their agreement in advance each time before you:
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <ul>
        <li>• email us, or ask us to email anything to you; </li>
        <li>• send any information to us; </li>
        <li>• enter any competition or game that requires information about you or offers a prize; </li>
        <li>• purchase an official membership; or </li>
        <li>• offer or agree to buy anything online. </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      If you are the parent or legal guardian of a user of our digital platforms who is under 13, they can access and use unrestricted areas but we will need your direct consent if they wish to gain access to restricted areas. If a user enters a date of birth which indicates they are under 13 when they try to register, our system will request them to provide us with your name and email address so that we can contact you to get your consent. The registration process cannot proceed without this. If we do not hear from you within 7 days, we will assume consent is refused. If you consent, we will complete the registration process. Whether you refuse or provide consent, we will update the child by email.
